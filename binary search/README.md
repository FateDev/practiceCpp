# Binary Search
Splits the list in two, and checks if the mid point is greater than or less than the search item.
If it is greater than, the first half of the array to search is ignored, and the process is repeated, until an item is found which matches the searched item. The same process occurs if the second half is ignored and it's repeated for the any number of binary lines of decision the program could go down, to find the item.
The complexity is O(log n), so scales up very nicely for large data sets.
